Please complete the steps to comlete on the following where the objective is to create a game where the player guesses the crime based on the mugshot using the Jailbase api (https://publicapis.io/jailbase-open-data-api).

Mugshot Game,

Idea:
See the mugshot, guess the crime.

Steps to complete:
1. Find Jail Api
2. Have Chat GPT Script Mysql DB Based on Json Schema
3. ....'


From chat gpt:

Step 3: Fetch Mugshot and Crime Data from Jailbase API

To implement this step, you'll need to interact with the Jailbase API to fetch the relevant data (mugshots and associated crimes). In this step, you'll make API calls to retrieve the data, process it, and store it in the MySQL database.

Here's a Python script using the requests library to fetch data from the Jailbase API and insert it into the MySQL database:

python
Copy code
import requests
import json
import mysql.connector

# Function to fetch data from Jailbase API
def fetch_jailbase_data():
    url = "https://api.jailbase.com/api/1/recent/?source_id=1"  # Replace the source_id with the appropriate value for your desired source
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data

# Function to insert data into MySQL database
def insert_data_to_mysql(data):
    # Connect to the MySQL database (replace these values with your actual database credentials)
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        database="your_database_name"
    )

    # Create a cursor to execute SQL queries
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Iterate through the records and insert them into the arrests and charges tables
    for record in data['records']:
        arrest = record.copy()
        charges = arrest.pop('charges')
        charge_urls = []
        for charge in charges:
            charge_urls.append(charge['url'])

        # Insert arrest data into the arrests table
        insert_arrest_query = "INSERT INTO arrests (id, book_date, source_id, source_name, source_url, state, county, first_name, last_name, age, gender, race) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"
        cursor.execute(insert_arrest_query, tuple(arrest.values()))

        # Get the auto-generated arrest ID from the last insert
        arrest_id = cursor.lastrowid

        # Insert charges data into the charges table for the current arrest
        for charge_url in charge_urls:
            insert_charge_query = "INSERT INTO charges (arrest_id, url) VALUES (%s, %s)"
            cursor.execute(insert_charge_query, (arrest_id, charge_url))

    # Commit changes and close the connection
    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

# Main function to fetch data and insert into MySQL database
def main():
    jailbase_data = fetch_jailbase_data()
    insert_data_to_mysql(jailbase_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Please note that the above code is just an example to illustrate how to fetch data from the Jailbase API and insert it into the MySQL database. You may need to adapt the code to fit your specific use case and database schema.

Step 4: Create the Game Interface

In this step, you'll create a user interface where players can see the mugshots and try to guess the associated crimes. You can build a web application, a desktop application, or even a simple command-line interface, depending on your target platform and technology stack.

Step 5: Implement the Game Logic

Finally, you'll implement the game logic that displays the mugshot to the player and asks them to guess the crime based on the available options (retrieved from the MySQL database). The player's input will be checked against the correct crime, and the game will display whether the guess was correct or not.

Remember to handle errors and edge cases gracefully to provide a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

That completes the steps to create the Mugshot Game using the Jailbase API and a MySQL database. Happy coding!

    // Fetch a random arrest record and its associated charges
    $getRandomArrestQuery = "SELECT * FROM arrests ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1";
    $result = $conn->query($getRandomArrestQuery);
    $arrest = $result->fetch_assoc();

    // Fetch charges for the selected arrest
    $getChargesQuery = "SELECT * FROM charges WHERE arrest_id = " . $arrest['id'];
    $result = $conn->query($getChargesQuery);
    $charges = $result->fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC);

    // Close the connection
    $conn->close();

    return ['arrest' => $arrest, 'charges' => $charges];
